First, I sincerely apologize for my dishonest behaviour before.No excuse can explain it.And I promise never to do it again.

This version of lab3 is a brand new one,I can guarantee that all the codes except the expression calculation part(aka,the "expcalculate.h","variable.h"),are all wrote by myself.

In this Lab,I designed:
1.a BasicLine class for each line we input
2.a BasicProgram class for the whole lines with linenumber
3.a Expression class and its three child classes for calculation
4.a EvalState class for the variables used in the basicprogram
5.The whole frame is like below:
{
	getLine();

	analyse the line;

	if(this line has no linenumber)
		run it immediately;
	if(this line has a linenumber)
		add it into the BasicProgram class,wait for run later;
	if(this line is any command that the interpreter need to provide)
		behave correspondly;
}
