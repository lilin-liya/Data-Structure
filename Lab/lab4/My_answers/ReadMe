In this Lab,I save the infomation of HuffmanTree and the file as following:

At the compress part:
1.the length of the result_str; (write as int)
2.the unique char nums in the inputfile;(write as int)
3.the unique chars in the inputfile;(write as unsigned char)
4.the frequency of each unique char in the inputfile;(write as int)
5.the result_str;(write as unsigned char)
6.the num of 0 I add at the end of the result str,aka,lackbits;(write as unsigned char)

At the decompress part:
read the special variable in the order above,then I can recreate the HuffmanTree
